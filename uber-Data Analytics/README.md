# Uber Data Analytics | Modern Data Engineering GCP Project

## Introduction

This ambitious project focuses on leveraging cutting-edge tools like GCP Storage, Python, Compute Instance, Mage Data Pipeline Tool, BigQuery, and Looker Studio for Uber data analytics. The integration of these technologies allows us to extract, transform, and analyze vital ride records efficiently. Our goal is to uncover valuable insights, such as ride patterns and peak hours, enabling resource optimization and improved service efficiency. Python facilitates agile data processing, while Compute Instance ensures ample computational power. The Mage Data Pipeline Tool streamlines data flow, and BigQuery empowers in-depth querying. Looker Studio's visualizations aid stakeholders in making data-driven decisions for enhanced user experience and strategic growth.
